**_Official Bot - @BillyHerringtonGodBot_** (_not working_ now)

## About
This is currently my _main_ bot, and I am working on it

It's Billy, but in Telegram! (as you can see from the name of the repository)

He has a level system and several commands

## List of commands
* /start - Sending a message for users, who started the bot in first time
* /help - Sending a message with the list of commands and descriptions
* /profile - Sending a message with the profile statistics that was passed in the arguments (when passing to a command)
* /lvl - The same as the "profile" command, but only with the level
* /fisting - Make a fisting to the user (when passing to a command)
* /deep - Check a deep of the user (when passing to a command)
* /warm - Feel a warm of the user (when passing to a command)
